## Get some data
```{r}
# Get some data from fivethirtyeight.com
# install.packages("fivethirtyeight")
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(package = "fivethirtyeight")
```

## Choose a data set
The data set I am interested in is "bad_drivers". This data set mainly describes the raw data behind the story "Dear Mona, Which State Has The Worst Drivers?". For more infromation, please visit [fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-state-has-the-worst-drivers/)


## Show the data
```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# install.packages("DT")
# install.packages("knitr")
library(DT)
library(knitr)
summary(bad_drivers)
datatable(bad_drivers)
df <- bad_drivers[1:10,c(1:5)]
colnames(df) <- c("states", "drivers", "speeding", "alchol", "not distracted")
kable(df)
```


## Add some Latex formulas
We can assume that there is a linear relationship between drivers and speeding.
$$num_drivers = \alpha*speeding + 4.5*\beta$$


## Add a plot
```{r}
plot(drivers~speeding, df, main="drivers vs speeding")
```


## Add a picture
![bad drivers cause to accident](bad_drivers.jpg)


## Add footnote and block quote
> The driver is the most important factor in keeping driving from being a ¡°cinch.¡± Automotive engineering may make the car easier to drive. Highway engineering and traffic engineering may make the highways and streets safer to use. Safety devices and clever inventions may help lessen the hazards in unfavorable weather conditions. But, in spite of all such improvements, first-rate driving will always demand that the driver act in accordance with sportsmanlike attitudes. [^1]
