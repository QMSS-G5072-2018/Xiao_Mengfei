## Get some data
```{r}
# Get some data from fivethirtyeight.com
# install.packages("fivethirtyeight")
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(package = "fivethirtyeight")
```

## Choose a data set
The data set I am interested in is "bad_drivers". This data set mainly describes the raw data behind the story "Dear Mona, Which State Has The Worst Drivers?". For more infromation, please visit [fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-state-has-the-worst-drivers/)


## Show the data
```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# install.packages("DT")
# install.packages("knitr")
library(DT)
library(knitr)
summary(bad_drivers)
datatable(bad_drivers)
df <- bad_drivers[1:10,c(1:5)]
colnames(df) <- c("states", "drivers", "speeding", "alchol", "not distracted")
kable(df)
```

## Add some Latex formulas
We can assume that there is a linear relationship between drivers and speeding.
$$num_drivers = \alpha*speeding + 4.5*\beta$$


## Add a plot
```{r}
plot(drivers~speeding, df, main="drivers vs speeding")
```

## Add a picture
![bad drivers cause to accident](bad_drivers.jpg)
