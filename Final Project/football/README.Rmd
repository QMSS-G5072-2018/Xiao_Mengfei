## Package "football"

The goal of package "football" is to get the football data information of football teams from England. Some summary statistics and graphical visualizations are also provided in this package. I use some technical abilities throughout the course of QMSS G5072 Modern Data Structure, including acquisition, cleaning, transformation, organization, and presentation of data. 


## Installation

You can install the released version of "football" from [Github](https://github.com/QMSS-G5072-2018/Xiao_Mengfei). 

Or you can transfer the entire package into a binary package, then select "Tools -> Install Package" from the top options in R Studio, and then library this package. Finally, you can use it and run the examples in each function file.
