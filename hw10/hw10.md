```
##   count(*)
## 1      121
```


#### c) Proportion of the devils are male

male_count <-  dbGetQuery(witch_con, "select sum(devil_type = 'Male') from devilappearance")
all_count <- dbGetQuery(witch_con, "select count(devil_type) from devilappearance")
male_count$`sum(devil_type = 'Male')`[1]/all_count$`count(devil_type)`[1]
```

```
## [1] 0.6345178
```



### 3. The Trial
#### a) Average and Maximum numbers of male and female accusers

```r
dbGetQuery(witch_con, "select max(male_accusers), avg(male_accusers), 
           max(female_accusers), avg(female_accusers) from trial")
```

```
##   max(male_accusers) avg(male_accusers) max(female_accusers)
## 1                 48             0.4182                   27
##   avg(female_accusers)
## 1               0.2559
```


#### b) List the number of sentences by sentence typeist in a table

```r
dbGetQuery(witch_con, "select sentence as 'sentence_type', count(sentence) as 'Freq'
           from trial group by sentence order by count(sentence) desc")
```

```
##         sentence_type Freq
## 1           Execution  205

## 10 Public Humiliation    1
## 11               <NA>    0
```


#### c) Compare the average number of accusers by the type of verdict

```r
dbGetQuery(witch_con, "select verdict as 'verdict_type', avg(male_accusers+female_accusers) as 
           'Average accusers' from trial where verdict<>'' group by verdict order by 
           avg(male_accusers+female_accusers) desc")
```

```
##   verdict_type Average accusers
## 1       Guilty           5.8043
## 2   Not Guilty           4.5581
## 3   Not Proven           1.0000
## 4  Half Guilty           0.2857
```


### 4. Tortured Truth
#### a) Left join the trial and confession tables

```r
dbGetQuery(witch_con, "SELECT count(distinct(confession.confessionref)) as 'Number_of_Confession', 
           count(distinct(trial.trialref)) as 'Number_of_Trial', 
           count(distinct(confession.confessionref))/count(distinct(trial.trialref)) 
           as 'Share_of_Trial_with_confession' 
           FROM trial LEFT JOIN confession ON trial.trialref = confession.trialref")
```

```
##   Number_of_Confession Number_of_Trial Share_of_Trial_with_confession
## 1                  941            3211                         0.2931
```


#### b)
**Conclusion:** Only 110 of trials have records of torture, and among of which have 35 confessions. Therefore, there is a higher share of confessions among trials with records of torture than trials without such record since the share is 0.3182, larger than 0.2931 in Quesion 4a).

```r
dbGetQuery(witch_con, "select count(distinct(torture.tortureref)) as 'Number_of_Torture', 
           count(distinct(confession.confessionref)) as 'Number_of_Torture_with_Confession', 
           count(distinct(confession.confessionref))/count(distinct(torture.tortureref))
           as 'Share_of_Torture_with_Confession' 
           FROM torture left join confession on torture.trialref = confession.trialref")
```

```
##   Number_of_Torture Number_of_Torture_with_Confession
## 1               110                                35
##   Share_of_Torture_with_Confession
## 1                           0.3182
```
```
